# Pydbscan
I first wrote an implementation of DBSCAN (see dbscan.py).
Then, I tested the algorithm comparing it with the Scikit-learn implementation (see comparisons.py).
Lastly, I generated some plots to use them in the presentation (see show.py).

All generated images were previously stored in the folder `output`.

## Requirements
You need to install Python3 and some libraries before running the scripts:
* numpy;
* matplotlib;
* sklearn;
